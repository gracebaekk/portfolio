I created a fully functional implementation of the classic 2048 tile-matching puzzle game. The game challenges players to combine numbered tiles on a grid by sliding them in four directions, with the goal of creating a tile with the value 2048.

I implemented all core game mechanics including tile movement, merging logic, random tile generation, and win/lose condition detection. The game features smooth animations and responsive controls that provide an engaging user experience. This project helped me develop strong skills in game logic design, state management, and user interface development.
